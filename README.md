# Journal Entry Times
A visual representation of each of the times an entry is made into a Day One journal.

## Running
To run from the root dir:
- Install all dependencies needed from requirements.txt
- Copy your exported diary JSON into ./data/
```sh
python3 ./source/graph.py ./data/<DIARY>.json
```

## Inspiration
